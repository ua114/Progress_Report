abstract="The motion of vortex rings of small cross section is considered. A formula is given for the velocity of a ring in an ideal fluid with an arbitrary distribution of vorticity in the core and an arbitrary circumferential velocity. A definition of velocity is given for the unsteady diffusing ring in a viscous fluid, and the speed is found by the method used for rings in ideal fluids.",
